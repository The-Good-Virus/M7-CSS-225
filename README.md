This repository is for practicing functions and methods
This asignment links back to the first module for helping me understand the proccess of trial and error.
I had issues in compeleting this moudle but kept note of the main errors that I was making.
There for the connection of these two modules would be code repretition and add on's.
It takes up less time and you get to accomplish more work in the end by molding projects together.
